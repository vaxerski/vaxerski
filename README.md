Owner, creator and Lead Developer of the hyprwm organization.<br/>
I have been coding in C++ since the age of 9.<br/>
As a hobby, I do graphics, listen to music and play some games. That's pretty much it.<br/>
<br/>
*Support me on ko-fi if you like what I am doing and have some spare pennies :D*

**Hypr** [ m ] is an X11 tiling window manager with unique features and a clean and expandable codebase.<br/>
**Hyprland** [ s ] is a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor using wlroots and aiming to provide a nice experience for those seeking more.<br/>
**Harakiri** [ f? ] is a Minecraft Utility Mod for 1.12.2, aimed at anarchy servers. It has the best visuals, ever.<br/>
**Mosaic** [ f? ] is still one of my favorites, even if its code quality is questionable. (I was young, forgive me :P)<br/>
**ZoomWebcamFix** [ f ] was a fix that helped thousands of people whose webcams stopped working because of Zoom's poor code.<br/>
**Civ4RPC** [ f ] is a simple Discord RPC info collector for CIV4:BtS<br/>
*Just to name a few...*<br/>

*f - finished, uf - unfinished, m - mature, s - stable*<br/><br/>
